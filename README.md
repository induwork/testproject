# testproject
This is a Flask app.
where in people can enter any public repo url eg: https://www.github.com/Shippable/support and get all the details on open issues.


If i had some time:-
1. I would have worked on styling and ui.
2. Even tried some other approach and could have used better liberaries and api clients,now i have used lot of quick fixes.
3.The entire app could have been setup inside docker container and managed easily.

# testproject
This is a Flask app.
where in people can enter any public repo url eg: https://www.github.com/Shippable/support and get all the details about repo open issues.


If i had some time:-
I would have worked on styling and ui.
Even tried some other approach and could have used better liberaries and api clients,now i have used lot of quick fixes and code is not properly managed.
I wanted The entire app to be setup inside docker container and deployed on aws but due to time constrain i couldnt do that.
